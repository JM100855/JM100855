## Hi there 👋 I'm Joshita Malla

I am a Computer Science graduate and a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at Stony Brook University (Dec 2025) with hands-on experience as an AI Engineer, Graduate Research Assistant, and Software Engineer Intern at Kalven Technologies, Stony Brook University, and Microsoft. I specialize in building production-grade AI and distributed systems using Python, Java, and C++, with a strong focus on LLM-based document intelligence, RAG pipelines, and large-scale ETL and streaming systems. My work includes developing automation agents that reduced manual workflows by 26%, real-time fraud detection systems using PyTorch, Spark, and Kafka, and secure decentralized healthcare platforms using blockchain and smart contracts. I bring a strong combination of software engineering fundamentals, applied machine learning, and system design to deliver scalable, reliable, and user-centric solutions.
